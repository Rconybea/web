.. py:class:: zstream.ZstreamBase(filename, mode, bufsize)

   I/O class that works with compressed (``.gzip``) native data.
   Automatically deflates output and inflates input

   Inherits `io.IOBase <https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/io.html#i-o-base-classes>`_

   `io.IOBase` behavior:

   .. py:method:: seekable()

      ``False``: ZstreamBase does not support seek

   .. py:method:: truncate()

      raises ``OSError``: ZstreamBase does not support truncate

   .. py:method:: flush()

      Does not guarantee all output written to disk.
      That requirement would be problematic for zlib, since deflated representation up to some position **p**
      typically depends on output after **p**.

      All output *will* be flushed on ``IOBase.close()`` [#]_

   ZstreamBase provides these methods in addition to those from IOBase:

   .. py:method:: openmode()

      Return native (c++ iostream) bitmask recording flags set when this stream last opened.

   .. py:method:: eof()

      ``True`` if input position is at end-of-file

   .. py:method:: read(z = -1, /)

      Read up to *z* characters / bytes.   In text mode return `str`; in binary mode return `bytes`

   .. py:method:: readinto(b, /)

      Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable *bytes-like object* *b* and return the number of bytes read.
      For example, this will work with python classes that support the buffer protocol.

   .. py:method:: write(obj, /)

      Write string (in text mode) or object (in binary mode) to stream.
      Returns the number of bytes used before compression.
